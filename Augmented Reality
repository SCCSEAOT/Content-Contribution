What is Augmented Reality?

Augmented Reality is a highly interactive and enhanced version of the real- world 
environment where the real world is modified with computer-generated visual, auditory, 
sensory, olfactory simulations. The dictionary meaning of augment is to increase the amount, 
value, size, etc. of something. So in simple terms, Augmented Reality is to augment or 
enhance the real world environment with digitized objects. Basically, it is a way of 
overlaying digital products on this real physical world to make its environment more 
interactive and informative.
